  "title": "Tierkreis: A Dataflow Framework for Hybrid Quantum-Classical Computing",
  "abstract": "We present Tierkreis, a higher-order dataflow graph program representation and runtime designed for compositional, quantum-classical hybrid algorithms. The design of the system is motivated by the remote nature of quantum computers, the need for hybrid algorithms to involve cloud and distributed computing, and the long-running nature of these algorithms. The graph-based representation reflects how designers reason about and visualise algorithms, and allows automatic parallelism and asynchronicity. A strong, static type system and higher-order semantics allow for high expressivity and compositionality in the program. The flexible runtime protocol enables third-party developers to add functionality using any language or environment. With Tierkreis, quantum software developers can easily build, visualise, verify, test, and debug complex hybrid workflows, and immediately deploy them to the cloud or a custom distributed environment.",

  "title": "Integrative Approaches to Cancer Immunotherapy.",
  "abstract": "Cancer immunotherapy aims to arm patients with cancer-fighting immunity. Many new cancer-specific immunotherapeutic drugs have gained approval in the past several years, demonstrating immunotherapy's efficacy and promise as an anticancer modality. Despite these successes, several outstanding questions remain for cancer immunotherapy, including how to make immunotherapy more efficacious in a broader range of cancer types and patients, and how to predict which patients will respond or not respond to therapy. We present a case for integrative systems approaches that will answer these questions. This involves applying mechanistic and statistical modeling, establishing consistent and widely adopted experimental tools to generate systems-level data, and creating sustained mechanisms of support. If implemented, these approaches will lead to major advances in cancer treatment.",
